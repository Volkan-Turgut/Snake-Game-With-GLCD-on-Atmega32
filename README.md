# Snake-Game-With-GLCD-on-Atmega32
The project is about playing a traditional snake game on a Atmega32 microcontroller displayed on a Graphical LCD. We used Atmega32 microcontroller for this project. The game is displayed on GLCD and the commands are givne thorugh an analog joystick. It also produces sounds with different frequencies for different actions. A very fun and educational project.
